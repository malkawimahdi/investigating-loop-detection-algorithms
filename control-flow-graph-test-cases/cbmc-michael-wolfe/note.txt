Note: CBMC has processed these input programs generated by Mahdi Malkawi to simulate the control flow graphs generated by Michael Wolfe in Flow Graph Anomalies: What's in a Loop?.

Although syntactic structure differs between the graphs shown by Michael Wolfe in Flow Graph Anomalies: What's in a Loop? and the CBMC generated graphs based on "main.c" for each graph, key concepts remain visible in CBMC interpretations.
