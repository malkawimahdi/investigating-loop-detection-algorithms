# Investigating Loop Detection Algorithms


## Prerequisites
To compile each algorithm and to generate similar results, a **UNIX** derivative, preferably a supported distribution of Debian/Ubuntu, MacOS or NixOs, is required:

[Bash](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/) to run shell-scripts

[GCC](https://gcc.gnu.org/install/binaries.html) to use G++ as a C++ Compiler to compile algorithms 1 to 3. Please ensure the version installed is compatible with C++ 17.

[CBMC](https://github.com/diffblue/cbmc/releases) to generate Lexical and Natural Loops results.

[Graphviz](https://graphviz.org/download/) to generate a control flow graph visualizing the c program used by shell scripts.


## Algorithms
Within each algorithms folder, there are two sub-folders for each generated algorithm. One folder contains the source code for the edge detection algorithm, whilst the other contains the results generated using the algorithm for each test case under a folder given by the same name and hyphen results, containing results.

Only CBMC algorithms deviate from this as the source code for their implementations is locatable on the hyperlinks below to the specific commit used for each algorithm, such that if the algorithms deviate after the ending of the project, the code visible by both parties is the same:

[CBMC Lexical Loops](https://github.com/diffblue/cbmc/blob/cafbcc44856ee3d3007b1f53de24a8b1c44580b6/src/analyses/lexical_loops.h#L1)

[CBMC Natural Loops](https://github.com/diffblue/cbmc/blob/cafbcc44856ee3d3007b1f53de24a8b1c44580b6/src/analyses/natural_loops.h#L1)

## CBMC Bugs
Contains folders for each generated bug report containing the supporting evidence for each bug report. A text file contains the URL to the submitted bug report for each bug.

## Control Flow Graph Test Cases
Contains a c program and its equivalent representation as a control flow graph. (*.goto) is an intermediary generated by CBMC to generate (*.dot) file Graphviz output. Files named "graphviz.svg" are the raw output control flow graphs. Each folder contains a single test case and the equivalent representation as a control flow graph.

Every folder contains a truncated (*.svg) file referenced by the test case name, which removes control flow graph elements provided by CBMC, to include the original program's control flow graph structure.

## Deprecated
Deprecated contains either incorrect or updated results and code that is ultimately non-functioning.
 
## Nix OS Configurations
Contains the exact Nix files to generate the exact system used to generate test results for generated algorithms.

## Shell Scripts
It contains shell scripts to generate results for all algorithms compared.

To enable execution and run these scripts:

```
chmod +x ./{SCRIPTNAME}.sh

./{SCRIPTNAME}.sh
```

"cbmc-algorithms-test-generation.sh" generates the results for both CBMC algorithms. This script contains five arguments, whereby one is mandatory.

```
-f is the input (*.c) program file given as input to the script (REQUIRED)
-l generates results for lexical_loops.h (Optional)
-n generates results for natural_loops.h (Optional)
-s generates a control flow graph from the input program returning an svg (Optional)
-h show all options (Optional)
```

"developed-algorithms-test-generation.sh" generates results for algorithms 1 to 3. This algorithm requires that it be imported into the source code's location to operate. It is located in a separate directory to avoid duplicating the script unnecessarily. This script does not take any arguments.
